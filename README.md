# Killers! Every single one of us!
> Maybe not all of us killing in active, but most of us do kill in a passive way

Dear Humans,

Our dear mother Nature, our home Planet Earth and our brothers and sisters (animals and life in general) are highly dependent on our choices and decisions we make every day.

And especially your children, more precisely your grandchildren, are more and more depend on your choice today!

## What kind of decisions are we talking here about?

- How much water do I use daily?
- Do I always need electricity?
- Can I reuse or recycle something instead of trashing it?
- Do I really want to eat meat? Should I buy meat today? What kind of meat to buy? Chicken or red meat? Why?

## Which questions are important to ask yourself?

- How much damage do I cause to the world and environment when buying some specific product or service?
- Do I really need this product/service in my life? Will I die if I don’t get it?
- Are there any better alternatives for this product/service that cause less damage?

## Is there a way to do better decisions?

Yes! There is! By gathering all the information about production procedures and making reasonable comparison that will show you that your choice matters! Every single choice matters! And we can calculate it into relative number of murders so that we can discover compassion in others and hope to make our world a better place!

## What is the plan?

1. Add products with brand, name, picture, category, tags, bar-code
2. Research and investigate steps of production 
3. Measure an amount of other products, materials, waste and radioactivity are used during each of that step.
4. Calculate relation “product A = X murders”
5. Start a social campaign to involve more people who cares
6. Start NGO organisation with a mission “No murders”
7. Establish partnership only with companies who supports the mission
8. Start petitions to legalize specific production laws and remove products with most damage

## How to list a product

Add `products/brand/product_name.md`
